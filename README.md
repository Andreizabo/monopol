# Monopoly  
![StartImage](https://github.com/vladvlad00/monopol/blob/master/Pictures/PlayScreen.png)
This project is an implementation of the well-known [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)) board game.  
## How to play  
Our game plays similarly to the original board game, having little to none differences.  
At this moment it is only possible to play it locally, on one PC.  Up to 6 players may join one session, each with their own pawn and name.  
After each player has made their selection, the game will start. From this moment forward the rules are identical to the original game and the session will end when all palyers but one go bankrupt.  
## The User Interface
The **UI** offers useful information about the game.  
  
#### This part of the UI will show whose turn it is, and also how much money each player has.

#### Here you can see specific information about each property, such as who owns it and what its current rent is.
